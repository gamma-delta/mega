# MEGA

aka, I'm so hubristic I think I can make Alexa.

This is my extremely extremely WIP attempt to make a personal voice-activated digital assistant.

The eventual plan is to be able to write commands in a folder tree using lua. Saying "Mega, utilities time" will have Mega look in for `utilities/time.lua`, execute it, and speak the output.

It will hopefully run on a Raspberry Pi.
